# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
The AirBnB Clone project is a Python-based command-line application that simulates a simplified version of the AirBnB booking platform. It allows users to manage and interact with AirBnB objects such as users, places, cities, and states.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter provides a text-based interface for interacting with the AirBnB objects. It supports various commands for creating, updating, deleting, and querying objects.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script using Python 3:
```bash
$ python3 console.py
